# MyReads Project

My Version of the "MyReads" project which is part of the React Nanodegree at UDACITY.

## Getting Started

You can get a local copy of the project by running this command on your console:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkfrei/reactnd-project-myreads.git
```

After that, you should have a new directory named "reactnd-project-myreads". Enter it by typing...
`cd reactnd-project-myreads`.

## Prerequisites

The project needs the package manager [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Installing

While in the newly created "reactnd-project-myreads" folder, install all the dependencies.

```zsh
yarn install
```

or

```zsh
npm install
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

#### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

## Running the tests

Currently no tests are defined. If you define tests you can run...

#### `npm test` or `yarn test`

## Coding style

The code was formatted using the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter and it's default settings.

## Build

#### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
